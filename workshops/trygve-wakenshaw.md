Have fun to develop characters. Have fun to pretend that no-one knows that it's you. Have fun to show us your beauty and charm and humour from behind your disguise.

Play with your playfulness.

We'll make some fun.



Trygve Wakenshaw is a great performer who specialises in physical comedy. Heâ€™s very funny with his body and his face and his ability to turn a black box theatre into a strange and magical world which charts the contours of his imagination.

Trygve trained with Philippe Gaulier for two years and taught at his school after finishing.
