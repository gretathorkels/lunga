Our workshop at the LungA festival 2018 will be an examination of ways to copy figures. What happens when you have an object or an image that you want to reproduce?

We would like to find ways to repeat and transfer ideas and give you a bit of an inside into the technical side of reproduction and print processes but also encourage new ways to copy an object.

This copy can variate in form from 2D in 3D, vice versa or stay the same. The focus of the workshop is within this transformation of the body and its process.
