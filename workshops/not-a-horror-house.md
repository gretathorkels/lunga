Imagine a Horror House where the objective is to make you terrified and scared. Let’s then swap the terror out for happiness and the scariness out for joy. What remains is ‘Not a Horror House’

In the workshop we’ll work together with the participants to create the piece ‘Not a Horror House’. Positivity, trust and friendship will play a fundamental part in this workshop. We know only one thing and that is if you want to make people happy, you’ll have to have fun yourself.

We want to create a structure around what it is that makes people happy. In this workshop we will investigate what it is that makes us happy in the purpose of making the piece.

What is happiness?
