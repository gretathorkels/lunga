We will find the comfort zone and enjoy the stay there for a couple of days. Then we will take a look at what is outside of the comfort zone and find out what we would like to try.

At the workshop I will introduce improvisation techniques used in dance, in making movement material/choreography. We will try out different ways of making material that can be used in the creation process.
