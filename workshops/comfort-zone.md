  Á námskeiðinu munum við finna þægindaramma hvers og eins njóta þess að vera
  innan hans í 2 daga og kíkja svo á hvað liggur fyrir utan sem væri gaman að
  hleypa inn.


  Á námskeiðinu verða spunaaðferðiri danshöfunda skoðaðar og vinnuaðferðir sem
  mér finnst frábært að nota.


  Þáttakendur munu læra aðferðir við gerð hreyfiefnis sem geta nýst þeim í
  sköpunarferli hver sem lokaútkoman er. Sviðsverk, dansverk, tónleikar,
  málverk, texti.

We will find the comfort zone and enjoy the stay there for a couple of days. Then we will take a look at what is outside of the comfort zone and find out what we would like to try.

At the workshop I will introduce improvisation techniques used in dance, in making movement material/choreography. We will try out different ways of making material that can be used in the creation process.
