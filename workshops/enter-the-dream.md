I had the craziest dream last night

\- what happened?

Wait, I´ll show you

What if we could experience the same dream? or even the same nightmare?

In this workshop we will use our unrestricted imagination to create art. We want you and all your surreal and mundane ideas so that we can together create a dream feast.

ENTER THE DREAM //



Dominique graduated from the Iceland Academy of the Arts in 2015, with a BA in Acting. She has worked as an actress and in film industry as an assistant director and casting director. During the last two years she has written and directed two plays for the Commercial College of Iceland. Her last project was inspired by the Norwegian TV show SKAM and was a great success. Dominique frequently uses devised methods and dreams in her work.



Born in Hafnarfjörður, Iceland, Sóley has attracted a huge following with her fairytale song craft over the last years. After the EP “Theater Island” (2010) announced her as a solo musician, the fantastical, sepia-toned alt-pop tunes of debut full-length “We Sink” (2011) already won her a massive, devoted fanbase: Often praised for her delicate take on composition, her songs’ “dream-like” qualities and “dark surrealism”.

Having studied piano and later composition at the Icelandic Art Academy, Sóley Stefánsdóttir, who was formerly a member of the band Seabear, released another EP entitled “Krómantík” in 2014, comprised of piano works and returned to even darker, nocturnal themes with sophomore album “Ask The Deep,” which came out in early 2015.

Her third album "Endless summer" came out in May 2017 and the album “Team Dreams” came out by the end of the year 2017 where Sóley collaborated with Sin Fang & Örvar Smárason (múm) as they released a new song on a monthly basis throughout 2017. A new album is in progress where Sóley is experimenting with new sounds and compositions like accordion drone, theremin and mellotron.
