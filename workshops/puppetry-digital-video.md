This workshop will explore the basics of enhancing puppetry techniques with simple digital video tools. The workshop will examine how to approach puppetry with video in mind, and investigate how to manipulate puppetry performance using video editing tools such as After Effects tracking and compositing. Basic understanding of video editing is suggested but not required.



Artist filmmaker Andrew Thomas Huang lives and works in Los Angeles. He studied Fine Art and Animation at the University of Southern California, graduating in 2007.

Huang's film and video work has exhibited at The Museum of Modern Art, NYC; MoMA PS1; The Barbican Centre, London; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. As an experimental filmmaker whose work bridges the gap between video art and film, he has developed a strong reputation for his collaborative practice, having worked extensively with Icelandic artist Bjork, among others.
