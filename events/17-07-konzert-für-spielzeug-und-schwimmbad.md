Performance 17.07 at 20:00 

@Swimming Pool 



Konzert für Spielzeug and Schwimmbad (Concerto for a Plastic Toy and a Pool) is a performance for a performer, plastic toy instrument and a public swimming pool.

Classical compositions, including the concerto, are traditionally written in standard forms using exposition, development and recapitulation to form a clear storyline and climax for it’s listeners. In Konzert für Spielzeug und Schwimmbad the performer takes on the role of the soloist and the swimming pool that of the orchestra. The piece’s monotonous and noisy melody de es the traditional forms of classical music by never ascending towards climax, providing the listener with a continual stimulus without a solution.

Hildur Elísa Jónsdóttir was born in 1993 in Reykjavík, Iceland. In 2015 she graduated with a soloist diploma in classical clarinet from the Reykjavík College of Music and in June 2019 she graduated from the Iceland University of the Arts with a BA in fine art. In spring 2018 she did an exchange semester at Hochschule Luzern in Switzerland where her piece, Konzert für Spielzeug und Schwimmbad, was chosen by curator Michael Sutter to represent the school in it's best-of exhibition K+. Hildur Elísa works mostly with time-based mediums and has performed widely, both as a musician and an artist.
