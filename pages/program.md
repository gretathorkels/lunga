# LungA LAB

is what we call our informative experimental laboratory. Each year we choose a theme, this year it is "future perspectives" and then we dig into that theme from many different perspectives, through workshop work, talks, various performances, movie screening, panel discussions and so on. 

This is LungA's way to contribute to the awareness of social responsibility on individual and collective level, in hope to effect and inspire those involved to take action and be more open towards the diversity of others in general. 

LungA LAB is made in collaboration with Erasmus+, Appelsín, Kaospilot, Hyper Island, University of Brighton, Myndlistarskóli Reykjavíkur.
